\unnumberedchapter{Introduction}

   Infectious disease modeling has emerged as a powerful public health tool in the last century. Beginning with early differential equation models first proposed by Kermack and McArthy, infectious disease modeling has expanded drastically, both in terms of theoretical and computational advances.  Many infectious disease competitions have emerged in the last few years, most often hosted by government agencies looking for academic research teams to assist them in decision making. These have included an influenza forecasting challenge hosted by the CDC, a Dengue challenge hosted by NOAA, and most recently a COVID-19 forecasting competition also organized by the CDC. The desire for accurate infectious disease forecasts at the decision making level is clearly increasing. The number of participants in infectious disease forecasting is also increasing rapidly. The Flusight challenge has seen a doubling of teams from year to year, and the COVID-19 challenge has seen over 30 teams submit forecasts during the pandemic. 
\section{Background}
While many are familiar with iconic story of Jon Snow and the Cholera pump handle, I choose to begin the story with the start of compartmental modeling. In 1906, W.H. Hamer proposed adopting an idea familiar in Physics, the law of mass action, to the modeling of epidemics. This idea, translated into modern terminology, reflects the fact that the spread of infection should be related to the number of infected people and the number of susceptible people in a closed population. Models based on the principle were put to use as early as 1911, where Dr. Ross built a compartmental model to describe the dynamics of Malaria. He showed that Malaria could be eradicated from a population, even with the vector present, as long as the number of mosquitos fell below a critical threshold. This lead to actionable public health measures, wehreby mosquito control targets were set based on compartmental model theory. 

The law of mass action led to the development of "compartmental model" theory by Kermack and McCarthy in 1927. However, the model originally proposed is quite different from the standard susceptible-infected-recovered model commonly described in the modern literature. The model they original postulated was defined as 


\begin{eqnarray}
  v(t) &=& -x'(t) \\ 
  x'(t) &=& -x(t)\left[ \int_0^t A(s) v(t-s)ds + A(t) y_0 \right] \\
  z'(t) &=& \int_0^t C(s)v(t-s)ds + C(t)y_0\\
  y(t) &=& \int_0^t B(s)v(t-s)ds + B(t) y_0\\
  B(s) &=& e^{-\int_0^t \psi(s)ds}\\
  A(s) &=& \phi(s)B(s)
\end{eqnarray}

where $x(t)$ is the number of susceptibles at time t, $y(t)$ is the number of infected individuals at time t, and $z(t)$ is the number of recovered individuals, $\phi(s)$ is the recovery rate at age of infection $s$ and $\psi(s)$ is infection rate at age of infection $s$. This model is sometimes referred to as the "age of infection model", since the model requires that we keep track of the time elapsed for each individual, i.e. their "age of infection". This model is heavily based on the differential equation identity commonly known as the Euler Lotka equation from population ecology \cite{wallinga2007generation}. 

\begin{equation}
  b(t) =\int_0^\infty b(t-a)l(a)m(a) da
\end{equation}

where $b(t)$ represents the number of births in a population, $r$ represents the growth rate, $l(a)$ is a function denoting what percentage of offspring survive $a$ time units, $m(a)$ represents the number of offspring a mother will produce at $a$ time units. Kermack and McCormick recognized that this equation could be mapped onto an epidemic by treating new infections as ``births".  We can transform the Kermack and McCormick model to the commonly known SIR differential equation model by applying the following transformation.

\begin{equation}
S(t) = x(t) , \ \ A(s)= B(s) = e^{-\gamma s}, \ \ y(t) =  aI(t)
\end{equation}


\begin{eqnarray}
  S'(t) &=& S(t)\left[ \int_0^t e^{-\gamma s}S'(t-s)ds + e^{-\gamma t} y_0 \right] \\
  R'(t) &=& \int_0^t C(s)v(t-s)ds + C(t)y_0\\
 \beta I (t) &=& -S(t)\int_0^t e^{-\gamma s}S'(t-s)ds + e^{-\gamma t}y_0\\
\end{eqnarray}


We can see, using the renewal equation, that $\S(t)int_0^t e^{-\gamma s}S'(t-s)ds = I(t)$, that these equations reduce to the kernel of the common sir model,


\begin{eqnarray}
S'(t) &=& -\beta*S(t)I(t)\\
I'(t) &=& \beta*S(t)I(t) - \gamma*I(t)
\end{eqnarray}

Under the constraint that $I(t) + R(t) +S(t) = N$ we can add the corresponding differential equation for the number of recovered, $R'(t) = -\gamma I(t)$. Thus, the SIR model was ``born", and became a leading tool for infectious disease epidemiologists to study properties of epidemics.

One of the most studied quantities to come from the simple SIR model is known as the ``reproduction number" or $R_0$. This quantity can be thought of as the expected number of secondary infections a single infected individual will produce at the start of the epidemic. The qualifier, at the start of the epidemic, is added to remove the influence of a limited susceptible population towards the end. This quantity allows for comparison across diseases. We can see the importance of the $R_0$ threshold value of 1 by re-writing when $S(t) \approx 1$, 

\begin{equation}
I'(t) =(\beta - \gamma) *I(t)
\end{equation}

Therefore, if $\beta-\gamma \leq 0$ (which is the same condition as $\frac{\beta}{\gamma}  < 1$the derivative of prevalent infections is negative, meaning infections are decreasing. If $ $\frac{\beta}{\gamma}  >1$ then infections are increasing.

\section{Challenges}
   However, infectious disease modeling still faces many challenges. On the applied side, these range from data quality issues, to parameter identifiability, to computational efficiency. Real-world infectious disease data is often incomplete, with under-reported of cases due to incomplete testing, revisions due to inaccurate diagnoses, and reporting infrastructure delays that cause significant backlog in reporting.  Differential equation models rely on key epidemiological parameters, such as the time to recovery, of a specific disease. Identifying these parameters from time series data only is a difficult task, and often leads to misspecification. In order to avoid this issue, non-parametric extensions to the classical compartmental models allow us soak up deviations in the data from prior estimates of epidemiological parameters. Finally, fitting complex compartmental models requires extensive computational resources, with fitting usually requiring an approximation algorithm such as the Runge-Katta 4th order approximation that is computationally expensive. 
   
   On the theoretical side, these range from how to effectively model interventions, understanding probabilistic disease models, and finding mathematically valid approximations to the common differential equation models. Intervention models have usually included a parametric or non-parametric model of the transmissibility parameter ($\beta$). Parametric models attempt to capture changes in transmissibility due to interventions such as limiting mobility. Non-parametric models are able to capture the aggregate level of interventions without relying on external data. 
   
 \section{Chapters}  
           In this work, we explore these issues by addressing three problems that arise in infectious disease modeling. First, we explore how to remedy the issue of forecasts that are made for independent geographies, as well as an aggregate geography, may be reconciled into a set of "coherent" forecasts, where the sum of the independent geography forecasts is required to be equal to the aggregate geography forecast. In many forecasting competitions, such as the FluSight and COVID-19 competition, forecasts are required for each state, as well as the nation as a whole. If the data-generating process is such that the regional data is aggregated to a national level, then forecasts for regional data should aggregate to the forecast for the nation. However, due to the variability in forecast quality by geography, taking the simple sum of the regional forecasts is not necessarily the optimal method. In chapter 1, we explore methods to aggregate regional forecasts to improve forecast score under probabilistic scoring. In chapter 2, we operationalize classical compartmental models to forecast COVID-19 in the U.S. in real-time. We extend the classic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model to include a negative binomial observation model, time varying transmission, and time-varying case detection probability and demonstrate the performance over the baseline model, as well as other models submitted to the COVID-Hub. In chapter 3, we use the Markov chain construction of the SIR model to demonstrate that the serial interval contracts as an epidemic progresses, and use this to estimate and correct for the bias in a common time varying reproduction number estimator.
